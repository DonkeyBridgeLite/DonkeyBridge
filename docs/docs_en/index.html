        <h1>Donkey Bridge Lite – Quick Guide</h1>

        <h2>What is Donkey Bridge Lite?</h2>
        <p>Donkey Bridge Lite generates secure and unique passwords for every account — completely locally, without storage and without any cloud.<br>
        <strong>Example:</strong> You only keep one single Crypto-Line in your head and get exactly the same strong password from every stored number sequence.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Crypto-Line (the ONLY thing you have to remember!)</strong><br><br>
            You really only need to remember this one Crypto-Line — nothing else!<br>
            The Crypto-Line must have at least 8 characters for security reasons, but can be as long as you like — even a full sentence, song lyric or movie quote.<br><br>
            <strong>Examples:</strong> „Mamba17_” or „Think it. Recall it. Donkey Bridge Lite” or „Think it. Recall it. Donkey Bridge Pro“ — that’s all you ever have to memorize.
        </div>

        <h2>Account notation is always a number sequence</h2>
        <p>The notation is always a number sequence from 1 to 8 or more, each number appearing exactly once and separated by commas.<br>
        You simply copy this number sequence from your PDF or e-mail and paste it into the notation field (R-Tool).<br>
        <strong>Example:</strong> In the PDF it says: <code>1, 3, 4, 8, 2, 7, 5, 6 – Gmail private</code>.</p>

        <h2>How to retrieve a password (R-Tool):</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Open your e-mail or PDF.</li>
            <li>Copy the corresponding number sequence (e.g. 1,3,4,8,2,7,5,6).</li>
            <li>Open Donkey Bridge Lite → R-Tool.</li>
            <li>Paste the number sequence into the notation field.</li>
            <li>Type your complete Crypto-Line (short or long).</li>
            <li>Press “Reconstruct”.</li>
            <li>The finished password appears below → can be copied and used for login.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> You paste 1,3,4,8...,28, type „Houston, we have no problem!“ → your password appears instantly.</p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>100 % local on your device</li>
            <li>No password is ever stored</li>
            <li>No internet required</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> The longer your Crypto-Line, the more secure each password becomes — yet you still only have to know this one line.</p>

        <h2>Summary — what you really need to know</h2>
        <p>Remember exactly ONE thing: your Crypto-Line — at least 8 characters, as long as you like (short code or full mnemonic from song/movie/book).<br>
        All number sequences are safely stored in your PDF or e-mail and simply copied.<br>
        <strong>Example:</strong> You can use „Mamba17_“ or „Think it. Recall it. Donkey Bridge Lite“ — both work perfectly.</p>

        <h2>How many passwords are possible</h2>
        <p>With just one single Crypto-Line you can generate <strong>8×8 = 64</strong> different, absolutely secure passwords — more than enough for a normal person’s entire life.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>The best part</strong><br><br>
            With Donkey Bridge Lite you only ever need one single password (your Crypto-Line) in your head for the rest of your life — Donkey Bridge Lite automatically creates all other strong passwords for you.
